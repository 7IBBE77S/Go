machine gun needs a wind up to get up to speed

weapon pick ups should not spawn if you already have that weapon type ie if you have shotgun you dont need more shotguns unless we add ammo


should add ammo maybe?

weapon pick ups need a more accurate pick up zone

regen isnt working (only client side)
when you die you still have the power up

teleport needs a cooldown

powerup pick ups arent going away they are polluting the screen (visually - client side)

shotgun should not be able to be spammed its fire rate needs to be limited

power ups are kind of buggly and sucky right now they need to be reworked

Add lobby system to the game essentially a menu that allows you to join a game shows everyone thats connected by session id (think xbox 360 COD lobby) click custom match to make your own and join match to see all available matches

give players cool little sprites (mech like robots, space ships, lenia like creatures, soldier, etc.)

maybe add stuff to hide behind thats destructible

change generateID to use UUID
